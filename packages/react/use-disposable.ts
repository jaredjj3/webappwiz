/**
 * Owns a disposable for the lifetime of a single mount. The factory builds the
 * resource; it is disposed when the component unmounts or when the factory's
 * identity changes (a constructor argument changed), at which point a fresh
 * instance is built.
 *
 * Pass a factory, not a prebuilt instance: a factory is what lets the hook
 * rebuild rather than hand back one it has already disposed. The instance is
 * built during render, so a dependent resource built later in the same render
 * reads the rebuilt one straight away.
 *
 * REQUIREMENT: the factory and the disposable's constructor must be
 * render-pure. They may wire up in-memory state and pure helper objects, but
 * must not acquire resources that need cleanup (timers, event or DOM
 * subscriptions, workers, audio nodes, network, global mutation). Because
 * construction happens at render, a render React abandons before commit (an
 * interrupted concurrent render, a throw elsewhere in the tree) builds an
 * instance whose disposing effect never runs, and anything acquired there
 * leaks. Acquire such resources after commit, via `useDisposerEffect`.
