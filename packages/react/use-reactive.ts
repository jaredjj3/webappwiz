 * `useResource` instance rebuilt after StrictMode retired it, or after its
 * deps changed) the hook builds a fresh store and re-subscribes to the new
 * source. `select` is read through a ref, so an inline arrow that closes over
 * fresh props still sees the latest values without re-subscribing. `events` is
 * read only when a store is built, so pass a fixed list.
