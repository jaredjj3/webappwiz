# webappwiz/skills

The agent skills a project has, under `.agents/skills`, and installing those
one repository ships from the tag of one of its releases, through the
`skills` CLI. A project's copy then always says which release it came from.

```ts
import { ProjectSkills } from "webappwiz/skills";

const skills = new ProjectSkills(root, { fs, ps, log, source: "owner/repo" });
await skills.add(["review"], "1.2.3"); // bunx skills@1 add owner/repo#v1.2.3 …
await skills.installed(); // ["review", …]
await skills.version("review"); // "1.2.3"
```

`add` skips a copy already at the release and one that is a symbolic link,
which someone keeps by hand, so running it again changes nothing and needs no
network. `versionOf(md)` reads the `version:` from a skill's frontmatter.
